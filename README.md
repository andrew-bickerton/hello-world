# hello-world
Test project

This is a test area.

I want to create an open source project encapsulating high throughput, highly customisable and stable queue management.

I call this system A.T.A.M.O.  

The plan is to create a core project with a pluggable interface for required components (so that it can be easily extended), separate projects for each extension (including default extensions) as well as set of Jenkins build/test suites.

My language of choice: C# in dot.net core
